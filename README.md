## Registration Form with Local Storage

This project is a simple **Registration Form** where users can input their details, which will be stored in the browser's **localStorage**. The form includes validation to ensure that the user's age is between **18 and 55**. The saved data is then displayed in a table and persists even after the page is reloaded.

## Features:
- **Form Input**: Name, Email, Password, Date of Birth, and Terms & Conditions.
- **Age Validation**: Users must be between **18 and 55 years old**.
- **LocalStorage**: Data is stored in the browser's **localStorage**, making it persistent across page reloads.
- **Bootstrap**: The page uses **Bootstrap** for a clean and responsive design.
- **Table Display**: All registered users' data is displayed in a table after form submission.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML** for the structure.
- **CSS** for styling (with Bootstrap for a responsive design).
- **JavaScript** for functionality, including data validation and storage in **localStorage**.

## Files:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the registration form and table.
- **form.js**: JavaScript file that handles form submission, validation, and loading/saving data to **localStorage**.
